JARVIS - Just A Rather Very Intelligent System


JARVIS is a cutting-edge, voice-activated assistant inspired by the AI from Iron Man. Designed to simplify and automate your digital interactions, JARVIS combines clap activation, virtual mouse control, and file automation to create a seamless, hands-free experience. While the current version operates independently of language models, future releases will integrate Azure OpenAI for advanced natural language 
understanding. We‚Äôre also using Eleven Labs to deliver life-like speech, making JARVIS sound as close as possible to the iconic film counterpart.

üöÄ Features
- Clap Activation: Activate JARVIS simply by clapping, enabling truly hands-free control.
- Virtual Mouse Control: Harness the power of hand tracking to control your computer‚Äôs mouse with intuitive gestures.
- File Automation: Perform routine file operations through voice commands and gestures, automating your workflow.
- Future Integration: Soon, JARVIS will feature deep learning-driven conversational abilities, thanks to Azure OpenAI, and high-quality speech powered by Eleven Labs.

üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure
Below is a breakdown of the core files that power JARVIS:

- FileAutomator.py: Automates file-related tasks with voice commands, providing a smooth, efficient file management system.
- cater.py: Handles user input and addresses mouse control issues for a more accurate and responsive virtual mouse experience.
- clap_detector.py & clapdetect.py: Detects claps to activate JARVIS. These modules ensure swift and accurate clap detection to trigger JARVIS instantly.
- hand_tracker.py: Tracks hand gestures, enabling control over the virtual mouse.
- jarvis.py: The heart of the project‚Äîthis file houses the core logic that drives the JARVIS assistant.
