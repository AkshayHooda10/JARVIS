JARVIS - Just A Rather Very Intelligent System
JARVIS is a voice assistant project inspired by the iconic AI from the Iron Man universe. It's designed to respond to voice commands and clap detection, allowing seamless interaction with your computer. While currently not running on any language model, future versions will integrate Azure OpenAI for enhanced functionality, and Eleven Labs will be used to provide more realistic speech capabilities.

Features
Clap Activation: JARVIS can be triggered by detecting claps, making it hands-free and intuitive to use.
Virtual Mouse Integration: Control your computer's mouse using hand gestures, offering an innovative way to interact with your system.
File Automation: Automate file management tasks effortlessly through voice commands and gesture controls.
Future Enhancements: Work is in progress to integrate Azure OpenAI for advanced natural language processing and Eleven Labs for more sophisticated speech synthesis.
Project Structure
FileAutomator.py: Automates file-related tasks based on voice commands.
Integrated Virtual Mouse: Provides virtual mouse control through hand tracking and gesture recognition.
cater.py: Contains improvements and fixes for mouse control, including user input handling.
clap_detector.py: Detects claps to activate JARVIS.
clapdetect.py: Updated version of the clap detection module.
hand tracker.py: Tracks hand movements to control the virtual mouse.
jarvis.py: Core functionality of the JARVIS system.
timetesttemp.py: A utility to test time-based operations within the system.
upload_button.py: Provides a simple interface for uploading files through JARVIS.

Future Plans
Azure OpenAI Integration: Leverage Azure OpenAI to add conversational capabilities to JARVIS.
Eleven Labs Speech Enhancement: Improve JARVIS's voice using state-of-the-art text-to-speech from Eleven Labs.
Expanded Gesture Controls: Add more hand gestures to increase interactivity.
Further Automation: Enhance the file automation system with more complex operations.
Stay tuned for more exciting updates as we work toward bringing JARVIS closer to the vision of a real-life assistant!
